Here's a roadmap for your end-to-end data science project, culminating in a deployed API or web app using Flask or FastAPI This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science pipelineâ€”from data collection and preprocessing to machine learning model development and deployment. The goal is to solve a real-world problem by building a predictive model and making it accessible through a web-based API.

The project begins with sourcing the dataset from an open data platform. The data is then cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling using standard preprocessing techniques. A machine learning model is trained and evaluated to ensure reliable performance.

After training, the model is serialized and integrated into a lightweight Flask application that exposes an API endpoint for making predictions. Users can send a POST request with input data and receive predictions in real-time. This setup is then deployed to a cloud platform, showcasing the practical usability of the model through a live demo.

Deliverables: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset Trained and saved machine learning model Flask-based API for prediction Deployed application accessible via public URL README with setup instructions
